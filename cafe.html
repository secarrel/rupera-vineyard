                    We'd love to welcome you to relax and enjoy the incredible atmosphere in our cafe. We believe that
                    connecting with nature is the best way to find your zen
                    and our cafe decor reflects this. Feel grounded while enjoying a coffee overlooking the vines or get
                    that happy buzz from a delicious glass of wine and a moment
                    shared with friends in our cosy bar area. We also welcome remote workers to pull up a seat in
                    the 'quiet room' which is designed to be a tranquil home away
                    from home.

                    We pride ourselves on healthy, highly nutritious bowls with unforgetable flavours, but we do also
                    serve alot of the classics. Our menu changes by the season so you'll get to try something new every
                    time you stop by.

                    Don't have time for a long visit?... or just love cake as much as we do? That's great! We serve
                    freshly baked cakes every day, made at a local bakery.
                    It's not only the cakes that are beautifully fresh in our cafe; our coffee is always freshly ground
                    and sustainably sourced. We currently get our coffee
                    beans from a small Cardiff-based company who live, sleep, breathe and of course drink coffee!

                    Scroll through our gallery below to see some of the events we've held in our cafe. We have weekly
                    events that are just so fun we can't help but bring them back each week, and some special one-off
                    events
                    that you don't want to miss. Our cafe is open exclusievly for these events so our usual food and
                    drinks menu won't be available.
