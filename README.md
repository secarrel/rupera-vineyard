## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Color pallet](documentation/color_pallet.png)

- Purple and black were the main colours used to portray the luxury and quality of the vineyard. Purple is also the colour of some grapes so thought this fitted well with the theme of the website. Black also makes the images stand out. Hints of gold are used to highlight buttons and links, as it contrasts well with the darker colours.

- Black and purple were used in blocks to indicate different sections of the website. This helps users navigate the website. 

### Typography

![Main Font](documentation/primary_font.png)

- 'Cormorant Garamond' Google Font was used throughout the website as it is clear so improves readability but also has 'classy' connotations.
