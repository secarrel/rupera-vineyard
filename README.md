## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Color pallet](documentation/color_pallet.png)

- Purple and black were the main colours used to portray the luxury and quality of the vineyard. Purple is also the colour of some grapes so thought this fitted well with the theme of the website. Black also makes the images stand out. Hints of gold are used to highlight buttons and links, as it contrasts well with the darker colours.

- Black and purple were used in blocks to indicate different sections of the website. This helps users navigate the website. 

### Typography

![Main Font](documentation/primary_font.png)

- 'Cormorant Garamond' Google Font was used throughout the website as it is clear so improves readability but also has 'classy' connotations.

## Future improvements
- improve gallery display in 'Café' page so the bottom edge of the gallery is a straight line. 
- add custom 404 page;
- improve the quality of the commit messages. At the start of the project, commit messages are too long and don't use key words ('Add', 'Modify', 'Feat:', 'Fix'). This improves toward the end of the project but there is still work to be done.
- Improve the functionality of the contact form.
