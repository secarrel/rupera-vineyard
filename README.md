## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour pallet](documentation\read_me_images\colours.png)

- Purple and black were the main colours used to portray the luxury and quality of the vineyard. Purple is also the colour of some grapes so thought this fitted well with the theme of the website. Black also makes the images stand out. Hints of gold are used to highlight buttons and links, as it contrasts well with the darker colours.

- Black and purple were used in blocks to indicate different sections of the website. This helps users navigate the website. 

### Typography

![Main Font](documentation/read_me_images/primary_font.png)

- 'Cormorant Garamond' Google Font was used throughout the website as it is clear so improves readability but also has 'classy' connotations.

+ ### Bugs
    - White line at bottom of page:
        + When scrolled to the end of the page content a white line could be seen. This stood out from the dark footer so I removed it. To find the cause of this bug, I used changed the background colour of different elements and found that there was margin on the '<ul>' element which contained the social media links in the footer. I set this margin to '0' and this fixed the bug.
        ![White Line](documentation\read_me_images\white_line_bug.png)  
    - scroll arrow behind carousel on small screens:
        + When testing responisveness of website, I found that the 'return to top arrow' was hideen behind the carousel caption. I adjusted the z-index and gave the arrow a background to improve its visibility. This resolved the bug and improved UX. 
        ![Return-to-top arrow hidden by carousel](documentation\read_me_images\return-_to_top_bug.png)
    - Hero image on home page not full width when resizing:
        + The hero image wasn't filling the allocated space when resizing. This left a white space to the right of the image which looked bad and provided a poor UX. To resolve this I changed the sizing of the image at the smaller breakpoints to provide a max and min width. This resolved the bug and has improved UX. 
        ![Hero image not filling allocated space](documentation\read_me_images\hero_image_bug.png)
    - Contact form labels misaligned:
        + The labels in the contact form weren't aligned correctly on smaller screens so I adjusted the sizing and alignment on smaller screens to fix this bug.
        ![Label misalignment](documentation\read_me_images\label_misaligned1.png)![Label misaligned smaller screen](documentation\read_me_images\label_misaligned2.png)
--- 

+ #### Unresolved bugs 
    - Image gallery on Cafe page:
        + The images don't align at the bottom of the page due to the different sized images in the columns I craeted in order to display the images as a gallery. I looked at different ways of presenting these images in order to improve the apprearance and UX, but had trouble improving the appearance of the gallery. I have left this bug in the website but don't believe it has a notable negative affect on UX.
        ![Cafe Gallery mis-aligned](documentation\read_me_images\cafe_gallery_bug.png)

  - Click "Save" and page will be automatically refreshed to indicate successful deployment.

The live link can be found [here](https://secarrel.github.io/rupera-vineyard/)

## Local Deployment

You can clone this project to make a local copy.
In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:

- `git clone https://github.com/secarrel/rupera-vineyard.git

---

## Future improvements
- improve gallery display in 'Café' page so the bottom edge of the gallery is a straight line. 
- add custom 404 page;
- improve the quality of the commit messages. At the start of the project, commit messages are too long and don't use key words ('Add', 'Modify', 'Feat:', 'Fix'). This improves toward the end of the project but there is still work to be done.
- Improve the functionality of the contact form.
