                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We have 25 acres of planted vines which are cared for by our head viticulturist
                        and three grounds workers. We have 7 varieties of grape each with distinct
                        character, flavour and aroma; this is carried through to the wines and gives
                        each blend its own personality. We make red, white and sparkling wine from
                        our grapes, some are blends of the different varieties and some are varietal.
                        We don’t make the wine on site, but it is sent a short distance to a local winery,
                        keeping our carbon footprint low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team at Rupera Vineyard are passionate about conservation and sustainability
                        so our vineyard is managed organically, and wildlife is promoted through careful
                        planning and management. Our grounds team have created a beautiful wild meadow of
                        6 acres which is perfect for walks and full of life. We also leave wild spaces for
                        our hedgehogs and put-up boxes for the birds. Stroll past our wild meadow and you’ll
                        find our sunflower field which can’t be missed.

                            <p>
                                Seyval Blanc, Phoenix, Solaris and Reichensteiner are our white
                                grape varieties which are used mostly in our white wine blends.
                                The grapes are some of the most widely used varieties in the UK
                                but aren’t well known among the British public. This is because
                                they are specially developed for our climate so are rarely produced
                                from the most well-known wine regions of France, Italy, Australia etc;
                                that’s not to say they are any less delicious!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A variety almost everyone has heard of – Pinot Noir. We have a whole 8
                                acres dedicated to this fantastic grape. Not only is it useful for red
                                wines but is also an important constituent of our sparkling wines. Alongside
                                our Pinot, we have Triomphe d’Alsace and Rondo which produce our deep, rich red wines.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Our grapes are trained in a very specific way to maintain plant health and for
                                optimum yield and quality. Pruning and training is done by hand in the winter
                                and can take 3 months. During the summer we remove some grapes to reduce stress
                                on the plants and take out excessive vegetation to encourage airflow and prevent
                                disease naturally – without the need for chemicals.

                            <p>
                                Our most popular white wine is our dry white which is a blend of Reichensteiner
                                which brings floral aromas and Seyval Blanc which creates a crisp finish. Our
                                fuller bodies white is made using Phoenix, a grape which is full of bold flavour
                                and allows this varietal wine to stand in high regard. We have a sweeter white
                                which is a blend of Solaris and Phoenix.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Our varietal Pinot Noir red wine is our award-winning light-bodied red which has
                                been commended for being well balanced. Another award-winning wine is our
                                Rondo-Triomphe blend which is far richer and fuller-bodied; the perfect
                                accompaniment to red meat. We have experimented with aging some red wines and
                                have produced some exquisite examples. Our 2015 vintage is thought to be our best
                                bottle and is only available on the tours and tastings.

                                Pinot Noir and Seyval Blanc work together to create our sparkling wine which is
                                the perfect addition to any celebration. For a bit of a twist, we also produce a
                                blush sparkling wine which contains Triomphe d'Alsace as well, bringing that
                                beautiful, delicate pink colour.
