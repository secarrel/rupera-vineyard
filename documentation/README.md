# Rupera Vineyard
 ## Project Description
 For Milestone Project 1, I will be creating a website for the fictional Rupera Vineyard. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap will be  used for this project. 
 
 ## Website goals:
 - Inform visitors of the offerings at the Vineyard.
 - Update them on events.
 - Tell the story of the vineyard
 - Showcase products and ethos
 - **main target: increaes visitor numbers at the vineyard**




 ## UX
 ### Strategy
 *to consider...*
 - *What are we hoping to achieve in the first place and for whome?*
 - *Is the content relevant?*
 - *Why is this special?*
 - *Why would a user want this?*
 - *Competitor Review*

 Aims:
 - outline what facilities are at the vineyard (cafe/vineyard/meadows)
 - provide details of activities and events that are coming up
 - provide contact information so they can get in touch about visiting
 
 target audience:
 -  interested in wine and viticulture
 -  looking for a lunch or coffee spot
 -  looking for fun events to attend with friends
 -  looking for a nice envrionment to work from


 ### Scope
 *to consider...*
 - *What features should we include in the website, based on the strategy?*

Aims:
- a page describing main facilities (vineyard and cafe)
- a page listing and descibing upcoming events with details of times
- a contact form
- pictures to describe atmosphere and food
- 'contact us' buttons for ease

 ### Structure
 - *Is the content logically grouped?*
 - *Is the content the visitors want available and easy to find?*

 ### Skeleton
 - *How will the user navigate through the information and features?*
 - *How does the content relate to eachother?*
 - *What are the priority features? And how do we organise these?*

 ### Surface
 - *What will the website actually look like? Colours/typography/images/animations/transitions*
